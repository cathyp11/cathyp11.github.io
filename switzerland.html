                <h1>Spring Break in Switzerland</h1>
                <p>02.24.2017-03.05.2017</p>
                <p>Over the spring break of my sophomore year, I decided to visit my high school friend Julie who's studying in École hôtelière de Lausanne. It was my very first time visiting Switzerland. It was very cold but the nature there was resolving all the coldness. The mountains and the lake were definitely different from other natures I've seen. We traveled to Montreux, Lucerne, and Zermett. At Montreux, we saw Lake Evian and Evian Mountain, where water Evian comes from, across the border. At Lucerne, we saw Kapellbrücke, Lion Monument, and traveled to Mount Rigi. Julie and I traveled 6 hours to Matterhorn, the mascot of Paramount logo, by train and bus. Despite the effort, we couldn't see it because of the fog. I'm still disappointed but I'm planning to go visit again to go see Matterhorn and do paragliding.</p>
