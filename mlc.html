            <p class="head">Executive Summary</p>
            <p>Michigan Language Center (MLC)’s mission is to teach English and American Culture to people from around the world and empower them in their university, career, and personal pursuits. Together, students and MLC faculty create a community of support, friendship, and learning. MLC’s website is their main touchpoint with the world, informing prospective students of their exceptional ESL programs and convincing those interested to apply. Because MLC’s prospective students (users) are mostly non-native English speakers, there exists a challenge in effectively communicating to people of different languages, cultures, and backgrounds, in addition to converting these diverse users into applicants. We are seeking to understand how cultural nuances interplay with web user experiences and how MLC’s site can feasibly accommodate their global audience while maintaining a seamless and intuitive user experience. We will be focusing particularly on the specialized landing pages they have implemented and synthesizing our findings into a design for a Korean landing page to support their outreach efforts this year.</p>

        <p>
            In an attempt to capture their diverse student body without the overhaul of designing several versions of their main website, MLC has created specialized landing pages for Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, and Arabic speaking students. These pages entice users to enter their contact information, enabling MLC to reach out and personally assist the user’s needs. The landing pages have succeeded in lead generation and preventing users from floating on their site. Still, these pages only provide basic information about MLC’s offerings, are identical in design and content except for translation, and link everything to the main website. Because every prospective student must go to the main website if they want to find more details about program offerings and apply, we see opportunities in creating a better transitional experience from specialized landing page to main website through reconsideration of their content and functionality.

        <p class="head">Background Research</p>
        <p>One of our main research goals was to learn about how design principles and standards vary across cultures, if at all. Fortunately, we were able to find numerous scholarly articles and academic research studies relating to our topic of international usability and the implications of culture on web/UI design. According to every source we read, cultural contexts significantly influence the design and the expectations users bring with them as they interact with online interfaces. Key design components involved at play within cultural contexts include not only local language and time-date formatting, but also layout, symbols, content and structure, navigation, multimedia, and color. For example, in Germany, a “low context culture”, messages are aimed to be complete and concise while in Japan, a “high context culture,” messages are typically multilevel and implicit. <br> 
        Another major finding was Geert Hofstede’s model for dimensionalizing cultures, which has been frequently referenced in discourse related to global UI design. After conducting hundreds of interviews of IBM employees around the world, his team was able to identify a handful of consistent dimensions upon which cultures can be compared. Dimensions embedded in all cultures include power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism vs. collectivism, masculinity vs. femininity, long-term vs. short-term orientation, and indulgence vs. restraint. Experts in global web UI design applied Hofstede’s principles, offering ways each one may influence design. Using uncertainty avoidance (which refers to the way cultures tend to react to unknown matters) as an example, The Sabena Airlines website, a Belgian site who ranked a UA score of 94 (the highest in the study) was compared to The British Airways website, a UK website which received a UA score of 35. The Belgian website included a clean and simple home page with limited choices to mitigate the ambiguity of their site. The British Airways site, on the other hand, had more information, complexity, and interface controls, aligning with low UA culture tendencies to show maximal content and less control of navigation. While there was a vast amount of material that supports the impact of cultural nuances on web design, there is information lacking on how organizations can feasibly target an international market. </p>

        <p class="head">User Interviews</p>
        <p>We conducted user interviews with three MLC students.  The students were from Turkey, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia, and all students were looking to better their English in order to study at American universities after graduating from the MLC. We asked about the background of these students, how they found out about the MLC, their English skills, and, if applicable, their experience with the MLC website. All three of our students had a particular interest in studying in the Midwest, and heard about the MLC through word of mouth rather than research or the website. They reported that they all possessed some level of English proficiency at the time they were applying to the MLC and interacting with their website. We found that the students had not used the MLC website much besides when applying, but they regarded it positively in comparison to websites in their home countries. The students also had very positive experiences with their English classes at the MLC so far.</p>

        <p class="head">Design Process</p>
        <p>We began our design process by using our UX requirements from the research phase to brainstorm potential solutions. We also created task flows for each of our personas in order to understand where users are interacting with our design in the context of their different journeys. We decided to create low-fi sketches and wireframes with three guiding themes:  interactive, visual, and information dense. We iterated and narrowed down these three designs with multiple user feedback sessions in order to arrive at our final prototype.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="head">Three Design Themes</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Information Dense:</b> From the background research and heuristics evaluation of the three Korean websites, we recognized they all tend to have all the information in a single page for users to easily navigate themselves depending on their interests. In order to satisfy this perspective of Korean users, we’ve created an information dense design with all information in a single page and less interactions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Visual/Aesthetic:</b> For the visual design, with a client’s request, we wanted to reduce the burden on translation. With the less translation, the users will be able to understand the content based more on the visual aids rather than text. In addition to this, westernized websites take on a more aesthetic and minimalist approach to website design. By including this design, we hoped to also understand if Korean users still preferred the information dense design over what is considered the norm, and provides the best user experience here in America. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Interactive:</b> The interactive design consists of elements from both the information dense design as well as the visual and aesthetic. However, the interactive design includes more navigations to make a more engaging user experience with the page. The interactive design serves as a nice middle ground between the information dense design and the visual one which falls on opposite sides of the spectrum.

        <p>After we sketched our ideas on paper, we created low-fi wireframes on sketch that incorporated our design ideas that would satisfy our UX requirements. We took the approach of creating wireframes for three different phases: interactive, visual, and information dense. Each team member took a different section and created four to five screens. In addition to working on the individual sections that would comprise the specialized landing page, we also took time to create wire frames for the transition page.</p>

        <p>
            Before diving into designs right away, we started sketching alternative solutions to the design statement we created. All team members took time to create unique 40 solutions each with caption. Some of the interesting solutions we came up with are VR and AR where users can try placing the furniture in their house or check the view of the football seat for a specific ticket. After creating alternative sketches, we created storyboards for the scenarios of Jon Douglas and Mary Perry that we developed during the personas & scenarios stage.

        <p>
            We reviewed our design project’s results, including our competitive analysis, sketches, scenarios, and storyboards. Following the QOC approach, we worked through the design considerations for one critical feature of our project. By considering the trade-offs between different options, we produce a Design Space Analysis comprised of 3 QOC’s (Question, Options, Criteria). We highlighted the preferred option we would adopt, and explained the rationale for adopting it.

        <p>Q1: How should the categorical items be presented? <br>Option: List</p>
        <p>
            We wanted to leverage this opportunity to solidify our navigational structure and overall information architecture. The first question we asked was how the categorical items should be presented. Understanding this aspect of the application would set the basis for how users would navigate between each category. Our options included Lists, Grids (also referred to as Dashboard-style), and Tabs. While these are all common conventions, we decided that Lists would be the best option since it would take up little space while presenting items in an easily readable manner. On the other hand, although Tabs did have more positives aspects, we decided that higher interactivity - while it may potentially be a more engaging experience - may also require more effort from the users. Therefore, we chose to avoid it and proceed with the List option.

        <p>  
            After deciding how the categories should be presented, we felt it was natural to decide how the said List menu should be accessed. We assessed two options through the QOC process: the Permanent Home Page and the Toggle option, or more specifically, the Hamburger Menu. The former of the two would involve having a home page that users would navigate from, and would require users to navigate backwards in order to access again. The Hamburger Menu would involve a button on the upper left corner of the screen that would make the list menu visible upon selection. We decided upon the latter option for a couple reasons: for one, having the categories on the home page may make it initially easy to access, but we thought that it would require more user effort in general as users would need to constantly need to move back and forth to navigate between categories. Another reason was that list option and Hamburger options are often combined as a convention, and we felt that this would users to easily understand how to navigate. As such, we chose to combine the List option with the Hamburger option.

        <p>Q3: How should the search function be integrated?<br>Option: Search Icon</p>
        <p>
            Out of the two options of having the search icon only and having the actual search bar in place, we chose to select the search icon that displays a search bar on click. The search icon itself has a strong convention as it used an universal icon. The bar displaying after the click has the benefits of screen compactness and serves the same purpose of having a search bar at all times with just one click. The search bar would appear as the rest of the screen stays the same with a dim gray screen overlay to ensure to the users that this search icon does not take them to a new page but rather accessible anywhere in the app. The permanent search bar is easy access with less clicking for the users, but it takes up a lot of space on a relatively small screen we have for a mobile app.

        <p>
            After a lot of brainstorming, our team was able to come up with the beginning lo-fi prototype of our application. Even after our QOC, some things were changed. It wasn’t until we actually had to start putting design onto paper until some ideas started to pop into our head and things finally started to come together. We decided on the five tabs within our app that are home, categories, post, inbox, profile. Once we established these five solid, we had to decide exactly what each tab would look like.

        <p class="head">Usability Testing</p>
        <p>
            During our usability testing, we discovered several defects in our prototype. Our participants had common suggestions as well as their personal comments to improve our prototype. All three usability tests went smoothly with the unique input from each participant. The third one went quicker than the first one because we got used to the process and adapted to the roles that we were assigned to. We got great feedback on the interaction of the application and also the content issues that confused them. 
        </p>
        <p class="head">Paper Prototype Defects</p>
        <p>
            Our first defect was clicking the categories menu during the test. We originally made our users click on it to show them that they can access the categories by clicking the icon in the menu bar. However, we made the users press the back button instead of prompting to do anything more. We did not carry out our scenario fully. To fix this problem, we decided to add a “Tickets” feed that displays when the user presses the “Tickets” menu on the categories screen. This also helped us develop the interaction within our scenario, building the user story to first the user researching for a ticket to see the different prices, then to creating a post to sell a ticket. Another reason we need the “Tickets” screen is to show the users where the application transitions to once they submit a post about selling a ticket. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Another missing part of our prototype was the “Search Results” page. The users could search for an item, but our prototype didn’t have a page that would show the search results. This lack of feedback confused our participants. To fix this issue, we created a page that contains their search results by the search terms. This was designed to be similar to the home screen with feeds, but the search terms would also be highlighted to indicate that the results contain that word. To distinguish the sort/filter icon from the categories icon, we changed the sort/filter icon to a funnel icon instead of a three horizontal lines.

            To improve our design to more iOS like, we gave our design a makeover. Instead of using thin light gray lines, we got rid of the lines and added subtle drop shadows to block out each element. For example, the screenshots below show how we changed our Post page. From going to a drop down menu for picking the category, we came up with an app style screen with each category boxed into their own button. We also added smaller changes such as edit icons (pencil) and making the “Continue” button lighter until everything is selected before the user can move on. We also got feedback that we are using redundant icons. This confused the users because the “message” button was still there when the user accessed their chat through the inbox category. To eliminate this confusion, we changed the cancel button to an “x” and got rid of the message button.

<!--                     <p class="head">Usability Testing on Digital Prototype</p>
        <p>
            We got feedback that we could provide more context to the users. We are in the process of coming up with an app name, to make the purpose of the app more obvious. Our app provides clubs and events listings, but they were not reflected on the home page, making it look like just an e-commerce website that sells and buys. Our home page would use an algorithm that shows the user what they have recently viewed or what they are interested in based on their past clicks, so for this particular user for our prototype was looking for football tickets. To change this, we added an event page to see what event postings might look like. Although some events can still have price, we demonstrated what a free event might look like. 
        </p>
        <p>
            During our prototype testing, a participant said that they are confused if their post is posted or not. To display this, we added a gray background color to reflect a post that has been just now posted by the user themselves. On the right corner, we also presented when these posts were made.
