            <p class="head">Executive Summary</p>
            <p>Michigan Language Center (MLC)’s mission is to teach English and American Culture to people from around the world and empower them in their university, career, and personal pursuits. Together, students and MLC faculty create a community of support, friendship, and learning. MLC’s website is their main touchpoint with the world, informing prospective students of their exceptional ESL programs and convincing those interested to apply. Because MLC’s prospective students (users) are mostly non-native English speakers, there exists a challenge in effectively communicating to people of different languages, cultures, and backgrounds, in addition to converting these diverse users into applicants. We are seeking to understand how cultural nuances interplay with web user experiences and how MLC’s site can feasibly accommodate their global audience while maintaining a seamless and intuitive user experience. We will be focusing particularly on the specialized landing pages they have implemented and synthesizing our findings into a design for a Korean landing page to support their outreach efforts this year.</p>

        <p>
            In an attempt to capture their diverse student body without the overhaul of designing several versions of their main website, MLC has created specialized landing pages for Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, and Arabic speaking students. These pages entice users to enter their contact information, enabling MLC to reach out and personally assist the user’s needs. The landing pages have succeeded in lead generation and preventing users from floating on their site. Still, these pages only provide basic information about MLC’s offerings, are identical in design and content except for translation, and link everything to the main website. Because every prospective student must go to the main website if they want to find more details about program offerings and apply, we see opportunities in creating a better transitional experience from specialized landing page to main website through reconsideration of their content and functionality.

        <p>
            Before diving into designs right away, we started sketching alternative solutions to the design statement we created. All team members took time to create unique 40 solutions each with caption. Some of the interesting solutions we came up with are VR and AR where users can try placing the furniture in their house or check the view of the football seat for a specific ticket. After creating alternative sketches, we created storyboards for the scenarios of Jon Douglas and Mary Perry that we developed during the personas & scenarios stage.

        <p>
            We reviewed our design project’s results, including our competitive analysis, sketches, scenarios, and storyboards. Following the QOC approach, we worked through the design considerations for one critical feature of our project. By considering the trade-offs between different options, we produce a Design Space Analysis comprised of 3 QOC’s (Question, Options, Criteria). We highlighted the preferred option we would adopt, and explained the rationale for adopting it.

        <p>Q1: How should the categorical items be presented? <br>Option: List</p>
        <p>
            We wanted to leverage this opportunity to solidify our navigational structure and overall information architecture. The first question we asked was how the categorical items should be presented. Understanding this aspect of the application would set the basis for how users would navigate between each category. Our options included Lists, Grids (also referred to as Dashboard-style), and Tabs. While these are all common conventions, we decided that Lists would be the best option since it would take up little space while presenting items in an easily readable manner. On the other hand, although Tabs did have more positives aspects, we decided that higher interactivity - while it may potentially be a more engaging experience - may also require more effort from the users. Therefore, we chose to avoid it and proceed with the List option.

        <p>Q2: How should menus be presented?<br>Option: Toggle/Hamburger</p>
        <p>  
            After deciding how the categories should be presented, we felt it was natural to decide how the said List menu should be accessed. We assessed two options through the QOC process: the Permanent Home Page and the Toggle option, or more specifically, the Hamburger Menu. The former of the two would involve having a home page that users would navigate from, and would require users to navigate backwards in order to access again. The Hamburger Menu would involve a button on the upper left corner of the screen that would make the list menu visible upon selection. We decided upon the latter option for a couple reasons: for one, having the categories on the home page may make it initially easy to access, but we thought that it would require more user effort in general as users would need to constantly need to move back and forth to navigate between categories. Another reason was that list option and Hamburger options are often combined as a convention, and we felt that this would users to easily understand how to navigate. As such, we chose to combine the List option with the Hamburger option.

        <p>
            Out of the two options of having the search icon only and having the actual search bar in place, we chose to select the search icon that displays a search bar on click. The search icon itself has a strong convention as it used an universal icon. The bar displaying after the click has the benefits of screen compactness and serves the same purpose of having a search bar at all times with just one click. The search bar would appear as the rest of the screen stays the same with a dim gray screen overlay to ensure to the users that this search icon does not take them to a new page but rather accessible anywhere in the app. The permanent search bar is easy access with less clicking for the users, but it takes up a lot of space on a relatively small screen we have for a mobile app.

        <p class="head">Paper Prototyping</p>
        <p>
            After a lot of brainstorming, our team was able to come up with the beginning lo-fi prototype of our application. Even after our QOC, some things were changed. It wasn’t until we actually had to start putting design onto paper until some ideas started to pop into our head and things finally started to come together. We decided on the five tabs within our app that are home, categories, post, inbox, profile. Once we established these five solid, we had to decide exactly what each tab would look like.
        </p>
        <p><a href="img/share/paper.mp4" target="_blank">Link</a> to Paper Prototype Demo</p>
        <p class="head">Usability Testing</p>
        <p>
            During our usability testing, we discovered several defects in our prototype. Our participants had common suggestions as well as their personal comments to improve our prototype. All three usability tests went smoothly with the unique input from each participant. The third one went quicker than the first one because we got used to the process and adapted to the roles that we were assigned to. We got great feedback on the interaction of the application and also the content issues that confused them. 
        </p>
        <p class="head">Paper Prototype Defects</p>
        <p>
            Our first defect was clicking the categories menu during the test. We originally made our users click on it to show them that they can access the categories by clicking the icon in the menu bar. However, we made the users press the back button instead of prompting to do anything more. We did not carry out our scenario fully. To fix this problem, we decided to add a “Tickets” feed that displays when the user presses the “Tickets” menu on the categories screen. This also helped us develop the interaction within our scenario, building the user story to first the user researching for a ticket to see the different prices, then to creating a post to sell a ticket. Another reason we need the “Tickets” screen is to show the users where the application transitions to once they submit a post about selling a ticket. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Another missing part of our prototype was the “Search Results” page. The users could search for an item, but our prototype didn’t have a page that would show the search results. This lack of feedback confused our participants. To fix this issue, we created a page that contains their search results by the search terms. This was designed to be similar to the home screen with feeds, but the search terms would also be highlighted to indicate that the results contain that word. To distinguish the sort/filter icon from the categories icon, we changed the sort/filter icon to a funnel icon instead of a three horizontal lines.

        <p class="head">Digital Prototyping</p>
        <p>
            To improve our design to more iOS like, we gave our design a makeover. Instead of using thin light gray lines, we got rid of the lines and added subtle drop shadows to block out each element. For example, the screenshots below show how we changed our Post page. From going to a drop down menu for picking the category, we came up with an app style screen with each category boxed into their own button. We also added smaller changes such as edit icons (pencil) and making the “Continue” button lighter until everything is selected before the user can move on. We also got feedback that we are using redundant icons. This confused the users because the “message” button was still there when the user accessed their chat through the inbox category. To eliminate this confusion, we changed the cancel button to an “x” and got rid of the message button. 
        </p>
<!--                     <p class="head">Usability Testing on Digital Prototype</p>
        <p>
            We got feedback that we could provide more context to the users. We are in the process of coming up with an app name, to make the purpose of the app more obvious. Our app provides clubs and events listings, but they were not reflected on the home page, making it look like just an e-commerce website that sells and buys. Our home page would use an algorithm that shows the user what they have recently viewed or what they are interested in based on their past clicks, so for this particular user for our prototype was looking for football tickets. To change this, we added an event page to see what event postings might look like. Although some events can still have price, we demonstrated what a free event might look like. 
        </p>
        <p>
            During our prototype testing, a participant said that they are confused if their post is posted or not. To display this, we added a gray background color to reflect a post that has been just now posted by the user themselves. On the right corner, we also presented when these posts were made.
