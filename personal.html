            <p>I wanted to create a website for a portfolio to introduce myself and my work. It would be static page to eliminate the inefficiency of visiting multiple pages. There would be four different sections of header, about, work, and contact. For the about section, it will include a brief information about myself including my resume and a few picture of myself and hobbies. In work section, projects about my coding projects and video projects that I’ve created will be displayed in a grid format. The contact section will have my phone number, address, email, and social media accounts to reach me. I want this website to be very organized, and thus provide a clear and easy navigation throughout the website. The progress bars for each skill will present the proficiency levels of the skill sets. I wanted to create this section to be visually appealing for the users to easily perceive the information at a glance. The use of limited colors will potentially administer a soothing environment to view the website. </p>

            <p class="head">Wireframe</p>
            <p>As I mentioned in the <i>Project Scoping</i> section, I've created four main sections to portray my portfolio. Since it is a static page, I thought it was necessary to have a clear header for each section to create a sense of division. By placing a header in the center-top of each section, the users can be aware of the transition into each section. In the low-fi wireframe, I put placeholders to create the structure of the page. Because it was important to showcase my projects, I thought work section had to go first in the page followed by other personal information of About and Contact. In the beginning of the page, I wanted to have a screen-sized image to create a sense of clean impression with less words. Since it was an online portfolio, in the About section, I added a button for resume for recruiters to easily find my resume. The Work section is in grid format to display multiple projects at once with a detail on modal once the users click on the image. The About section contains a picture of myself, resume, little description about myself, and skills. The footer is basically the contact section with my email, address, and social media links. In mid-fi wireframes, I replaced all the placeholders with actual content. In the process, I decided to take out skills from about section since they were listed on my resume. I also switched the order of About and Work section to introduce myself first before jumping into showing my work.</p>
