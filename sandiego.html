        <h1>Spring Break in San Diego & Las Vegas</h1>
        <p>02.24.2018-03.01.2018</p>
        <p>Over the spring break of my junior year, Dongmin, Sarah, Minjee and I went to San Diego and Las Vegas. Three of my friends were graduating a year early so we planned this trip as the last trip before graduation. We were all visiting Las Vegas first time after we all turned legal. Unlike what I imagined, Vegas had lots of factory stores that aroused our interest. We struggled a little on how to access Uber/Lyfts because they only allow rideshares on a certain stop. After staying in Vegas for 3 days, we flew to San Diego expecting a warmer weather. Despite our expectations, we had to suffer from a chilly weather but still very much of their food delights. Their Mexican food and beers were astonishing. The beach with the sea lions were eye-catchy and unique.</p>
