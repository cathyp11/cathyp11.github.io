                <h1>Food Tour in Seattle</h1>
                <h2>04.27.2017-05.05.2017</h2>
                <p>At the end of my sophomore, I went to visit my friend Catherine in Seattle, WA, as soon as I finished my finals. I went to middle school there and met Catherine at church. After I graduated middle school, I left Seattle and weren't able to meet Catherine until the end of my sophomore year. I've created all a video that had a shared interest of both me and Catherine: food. Most of the video models Catherine but there are few of my middle school friends as well as few of Catherine's friends, the Huskies, from University of Washington. I tried include some comments on each restaurant that we've visited but excuse all the Koreans. They are all in hashtag forms along with the location and name of the restaurant. The video contains very dynamic facial expressions of Catherine!</p>
