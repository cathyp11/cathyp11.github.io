                <p>Policymakers, school boards, community leaders, and the media talk a lot about young people and make laws on behalf of young people, without ever asking what youth really think. <br>MyVoice was created to give young people an effective way to share their real-time thoughts and opinions on the issues that matter most in their lives. <br>Many young people feel like their voices aren’t heard by the people shaping their schools, communities, and country.  With MyVoice, young people across the United States can sound off on issues that matter today, in our weekly, text message-based polls. We chose text messaging as the way to hear from young people because this fits so easily with their day-to-day lives. Do you know anyone that doesn’t text? Responses are quickly analyzed so they can be shared with the policy makers, public agencies, and community groups that are making decisions that impact young people’s lives. <br>The goal of MyVoice is to lift up the voices and experiences of today’s youth in ways that help local and national leaders create more youth-friendly policies and programs!</p>
