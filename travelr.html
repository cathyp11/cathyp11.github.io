                    <p>Many travelers plan ahead of their trip for their hotels, routes, and restaurants through Google Doc, Microsoft Word, and Excel. Currently, there isn’t a specialized platform or app that addresses this specific inconvenience of travelers. “Travelr” allows the users to keep track of their journey and organize them in sub-sections with more detail. Through this app, users can view their trip routes both on a list and a map with the places that they have visited or want to visit in the future. All elements such as locations, dates, and budgets are all manageable in one app.</p>

                        Through this app, people can easily export them in different formats and share with others about their trips. Without combining multiple tools to create map visuals and trip lists, this app can do everything at one place. The users will be able to save time and be convenient in managing their trips along with their budgets. In the future, this app can integrate social media so the users can post their trips within the app to share with other users. By integrating social media platform, the users will be able to follow their favorite trips or travelers and keep track of their own followers as well.

                        After a lot of brainstorming, our team was able to come up with the beginning lo-fi prototype of our application. Even after our QOC, some things were changed. It wasn’t until we actually had to start putting design onto paper until some ideas started to pop into our head and things finally started to come together. We decided on the five tabs within our app that are home, categories, post, inbox, profile. Once we established these five solid, we had to decide exactly what each tab would look like.

                    <p class="head">Usability Testing</p>
                    <p>
                        During our usability testing, we discovered several defects in our prototype. Our participants had common suggestions as well as their personal comments to improve our prototype. All three usability tests went smoothly with the unique input from each participant. The third one went quicker than the first one because we got used to the process and adapted to the roles that we were assigned to. We got great feedback on the interaction of the application and also the content issues that confused them. 
                    </p>
<!--                     <p class="head">Paper Prototype Defects</p>
                    <p>
                        Our first defect was clicking the categories menu during the test. We originally made our users click on it to show them that they can access the categories by clicking the icon in the menu bar. However, we made the users press the back button instead of prompting to do anything more. We did not carry out our scenario fully. To fix this problem, we decided to add a “Tickets” feed that displays when the user presses the “Tickets” menu on the categories screen. This also helped us develop the interaction within our scenario, building the user story to first the user researching for a ticket to see the different prices, then to creating a post to sell a ticket. Another reason we need the “Tickets” screen is to show the users where the application transitions to once they submit a post about selling a ticket.

                    <p>
                        Another missing part of our prototype was the “Search Results” page. The users could search for an item, but our prototype didn’t have a page that would show the search results. This lack of feedback confused our participants. To fix this issue, we created a page that contains their search results by the search terms. This was designed to be similar to the home screen with feeds, but the search terms would also be highlighted to indicate that the results contain that word. To distinguish the sort/filter icon from the categories icon, we changed the sort/filter icon to a funnel icon instead of a three horizontal lines.

                        To improve our design to more iOS like, we gave our design a makeover. Instead of using thin light gray lines, we got rid of the lines and added subtle drop shadows to block out each element. For example, the screenshots below show how we changed our Post page. From going to a drop down menu for picking the category, we came up with an app style screen with each category boxed into their own button. We also added smaller changes such as edit icons (pencil) and making the “Continue” button lighter until everything is selected before the user can move on. We also got feedback that we are using redundant icons. This confused the users because the “message” button was still there when the user accessed their chat through the inbox category. To eliminate this confusion, we changed the cancel button to an “x” and got rid of the message button.
