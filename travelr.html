                <p>Many travelers plan ahead of their trip for their hotels, routes, and restaurants through Google Doc, Microsoft Word, and Excel. Currently, there isn’t a specialized platform or app that addresses this specific inconvenience of travelers. “Travelr” allows the users to keep track of their journey and organize them in sub-sections with more detail. Through this app, users can view their trip routes both on a list and a map with the places that they have visited or want to visit in the future. All elements such as locations, dates, and budgets are all manageable in one app.</p>
                <h4 class="head">Problem Statement</h4>
                <p>Travelers want an easy way to keep all the travel information to easily organize and refer back to the places they've visited.</p>

                <p>
                    Gary is a photographer from Melbourne, Australia. He often travels to different places to take pictures. He wants to distinguish each trip since he travels a lot. Later, he wants to put together a photo book annually to reminisce.
                </p>
                <h5>Travel Agents</h5>
                <p>
                    Rachel is a travel agent at Vancouver, BC. She is currently promoting trips in Europe region but is struggling to attract more customers to Iceland because of the weather. She wants to advertise with graphics and landmarks to entice customers.

                <h5>Viewer</h5>
                <p>
                    Leah is a high school student in Boston, MA. Her brother recently came back from a mission trip and want to share a presentation about it to recommend it to her. She isn’t enthralled about it and doesn’t like to read long paragraphs. She wants simple and straightforward visuals.

                    <b>Introduction:</b><br> Introduce the app to the users by 3 pictures and phrases before they start using the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Account Creation:</b><br> In order for the user to start using the app, the user needs to make an account. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Trip Overview:</b><br> Provide all the trips in one screen in different views: list and calendar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Trip Creation:</b><br> Create your own trip with your details starting from trip title, dates, segment of trips, and places you’ve visited for each day.

                <p>
                    According to user A, the flow of the app isn't smooth when the user clicks on "start exploring" after sending an email to reset their password. When the user expects the page with re-login, the dashboard page pops up instead, which doesn't make sense since you're not logged in. Another confusion user A felt was the location and design of the buttons. On "Trip Creation" screens, "cancel" and "next" buttons seem out of reach and don't look like clickable buttons. User A wishes there are more button-like designs so users don't get confused on where to click. From user B, the cards on the profile seemed clickable but they actually weren't. For now, I designed the cards as displaying simple statistics for each profile, however, I'm more than open to design further to have detailed statistics screen.
                </p>
                <h4 class="head">Expected Outcome</h4>
                <p>
                    Through this app, people can easily export them in different formats and share with others about their trips. Without combining multiple tools to create map visuals and trip lists, this app can do everything at one place. The users will be able to save time and be convenient in managing their trips along with their budgets. In the future, this app can integrate social media so the users can post their trips within the app to share with other users. By integrating social media platform, the users will be able to follow their favorite trips or travelers and keep track of their own followers as well.
