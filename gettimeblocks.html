                <p>We all try to manage our time in a more efficiently in the midst of our busy lives, balancing scheduled events, to-dos, projects, including short and long term plans. Existing calendars provide limited functions, making it difficult to effectively manage schedules on mobile devices. Day2Life helps users plan and manage their time in an easier and smarter way.</p>
                <p class="head">Overview</p>
                <p>Our team redesigned the landing page of the mobile application website by researching the commonly used features and menus. By visiting multiple websites in the similar field of interests on the mobile application, our team developed a specific template to stimulate the users' visits on the website. In order to clarify the use of our mobile application, we added a scroll animation using JavaScript on the front banner that organizes the schedules in one application. A rough template was given to me and I was in charge of converting the design into the active website using HTML and CSS. Multiple JavaScript applications and libraries were added in order to renovate the web page. The website is in both English and Korean, but not in Chinese and Japanese yet. The page for Partnership is active as well.</p>

                    <p>Researched on top mobile applications based in Korea. By visiting various websites, we were able to discern few common features that all mobile websites had. The navigation bar height and the buttons on the bar were commonly done since users have to be able to easily login on the landing page. Many websites had scroll animations to transition more smoothly from topic to topic.</p>
                    <p class="head">Web Wireframes</p>
                    <p>Based on the competitive analysis that we’ve done, we created few wireframes that could potentially improve the features that we already had. Instead of a static image, we wanted to embed scroll animation for users to have a clearer idea of how the app is useful in organizing multiple tasks into one app. The old wireframes are the ones with green navigation bar on the top whereas the new wireframes have similar color throughout the website to show more uniformity.</p>
                    <p class="head">Mobile Wireframes</p>
                    <p>Since mobile interfaces are more restrictive than web interfaces, we had to make some improvements. We based all our designs based on the web wireframes we’ve created. However, some features that we’ve included in web wireframes were distracting in a smaller screen, so we had to improvise. Instead of including the scroll animation similar to web wireframe, we’ve just inputted a static image that would still deliver the same message as the web wireframe. Except for the header image, we’ve all tried to replicate the same elements from the web interface. </p>
