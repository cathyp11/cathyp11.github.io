            <p class="head">Executive Summary</p>
            <p>Michigan Language Center (MLC)’s mission is to teach English and American Culture to people from around the world and empower them in their university, career, and personal pursuits. Together, students and MLC faculty create a community of support, friendship, and learning. MLC’s website is their main touchpoint with the world, informing prospective students of their exceptional ESL programs and convincing those interested to apply. Because MLC’s prospective students (users) are mostly non-native English speakers, there exists a challenge in effectively communicating to people of different languages, cultures, and backgrounds, in addition to converting these diverse users into applicants. We are seeking to understand how cultural nuances interplay with web user experiences and how MLC’s site can feasibly accommodate their global audience while maintaining a seamless and intuitive user experience. We will be focusing particularly on the specialized landing pages they have implemented and synthesizing our findings into a design for a Korean landing page to support their outreach efforts this year.</p>

        <p>
            In an attempt to capture their diverse student body without the overhaul of designing several versions of their main website, MLC has created specialized landing pages for Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, and Arabic speaking students. These pages entice users to enter their contact information, enabling MLC to reach out and personally assist the user’s needs. The landing pages have succeeded in lead generation and preventing users from floating on their site. Still, these pages only provide basic information about MLC’s offerings, are identical in design and content except for translation, and link everything to the main website. Because every prospective student must go to the main website if they want to find more details about program offerings and apply, we see opportunities in creating a better transitional experience from specialized landing page to main website through reconsideration of their content and functionality.

        <p class="head">Background Research</p>
        <p>One of our main research goals was to learn about how design principles and standards vary across cultures, if at all. Fortunately, we were able to find numerous scholarly articles and academic research studies relating to our topic of international usability and the implications of culture on web/UI design. According to every source we read, cultural contexts significantly influence the design and the expectations users bring with them as they interact with online interfaces. Key design components involved at play within cultural contexts include not only local language and time-date formatting, but also layout, symbols, content and structure, navigation, multimedia, and color. For example, in Germany, a “low context culture”, messages are aimed to be complete and concise while in Japan, a “high context culture,” messages are typically multilevel and implicit. <br> 
        Another major finding was Geert Hofstede’s model for dimensionalizing cultures, which has been frequently referenced in discourse related to global UI design. After conducting hundreds of interviews of IBM employees around the world, his team was able to identify a handful of consistent dimensions upon which cultures can be compared. Dimensions embedded in all cultures include power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism vs. collectivism, masculinity vs. femininity, long-term vs. short-term orientation, and indulgence vs. restraint. Experts in global web UI design applied Hofstede’s principles, offering ways each one may influence design. Using uncertainty avoidance (which refers to the way cultures tend to react to unknown matters) as an example, The Sabena Airlines website, a Belgian site who ranked a UA score of 94 (the highest in the study) was compared to The British Airways website, a UK website which received a UA score of 35. The Belgian website included a clean and simple home page with limited choices to mitigate the ambiguity of their site. The British Airways site, on the other hand, had more information, complexity, and interface controls, aligning with low UA culture tendencies to show maximal content and less control of navigation. While there was a vast amount of material that supports the impact of cultural nuances on web design, there is information lacking on how organizations can feasibly target an international market. </p>

        <p class="head">User Interviews</p>
        <p>We conducted user interviews with three MLC students.  The students were from Turkey, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia, and all students were looking to better their English in order to study at American universities after graduating from the MLC. We asked about the background of these students, how they found out about the MLC, their English skills, and, if applicable, their experience with the MLC website. All three of our students had a particular interest in studying in the Midwest, and heard about the MLC through word of mouth rather than research or the website. They reported that they all possessed some level of English proficiency at the time they were applying to the MLC and interacting with their website. We found that the students had not used the MLC website much besides when applying, but they regarded it positively in comparison to websites in their home countries. The students also had very positive experiences with their English classes at the MLC so far.</p>

        <p>We began our design process by using our UX requirements from the research phase to brainstorm potential solutions. We also created task flows for each of our personas in order to understand where users are interacting with our design in the context of their different journeys. We decided to create low-fi sketches and wireframes with three guiding themes:  interactive, visual, and information dense. We iterated and narrowed down these three designs with multiple user feedback sessions in order to arrive at our final prototype.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="head">Three Design Themes</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Information Dense:</b> From the background research and heuristics evaluation of the three Korean websites, we recognized they all tend to have all the information in a single page for users to easily navigate themselves depending on their interests. In order to satisfy this perspective of Korean users, we’ve created an information dense design with all information in a single page and less interactions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Visual/Aesthetic:</b> For the visual design, with a client’s request, we wanted to reduce the burden on translation. With the less translation, the users will be able to understand the content based more on the visual aids rather than text. In addition to this, westernized websites take on a more aesthetic and minimalist approach to website design. By including this design, we hoped to also understand if Korean users still preferred the information dense design over what is considered the norm, and provides the best user experience here in America. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Interactive:</b> The interactive design consists of elements from both the information dense design as well as the visual and aesthetic. However, the interactive design includes more navigations to make a more engaging user experience with the page. The interactive design serves as a nice middle ground between the information dense design and the visual one which falls on opposite sides of the spectrum.

        <p>After we sketched our ideas on paper, we created low-fi wireframes on sketch that incorporated our design ideas that would satisfy our UX requirements. We took the approach of creating wireframes for three different phases: interactive, visual, and information dense. Each team member took a different section and created four to five screens. In addition to working on the individual sections that would comprise the specialized landing page, we also took time to create wire frames for the transition page.</p>
