                <!-- <p>It all began with an exploratory visit to the Tozzer Library and a book that we happened to stumble upon titled Honor and Comfort - Native Quilting Traditions by Marsha L. MacDowell and Dewhurst C. Kurt. This book opened us to contemporary and historical quilting traditions from Native American tribes around the country through essays and rare historical photographs. <br> -->
                <p>
                    Quilts were first introduced to Native American or Indian communities by European settlers seeking to "civilize" them through European home-making skills. However, these indigenous communities were intrigued by the bed coverings and made them their own by incorporating their cultural aesthetic and stories through symbolism and patterns into their quilts. Within the community, quilts today are considered quintessentially Native, but people hardly know of their striking art form outside of it. <br>
                    In addition, ethnographers of the late 1800's were interested in documenting parts of the culture untouched by European influence, thus portraying a stereotypical image of the Native American people as pure and primitive. They failed to recognize that the community was changing, and while the quilt on its own may not be unique, it gives a glimpse into the community's belief system and worldview.

                <h4 class="head">Research Questions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        How have quilting aesthetics evolved through time across Native American tribes?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Are there any visual relationships in quilting aesthetics, specifically in color and motifs across various Native American tribes and cultures beyond?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using generative technology, how might we explore alternate quilting aesthetics or new, hypothetical forms of connection between tribes?
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h4 class="head">Project Aim</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To help people discover, appreciate, and celebrate the indigenous art tradition of Native American people's relationship to quilts/quilting culture.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Understand the influence of other cultures on Native American quilting aesthetics. While the common perception is that Native American tribes are insular, this project contests that claim.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Daylight cultural appropriation over time - exploring alternative aesthetic possibilities and interconnectedness from traditions that grow from each other, learn, and depart or come together.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="head">Value Systems</h4>
                <p>Our process and outcome were embedded in a clear set of values that aided decision-making and served as a moral compass for the project. As we were working with unstructured, image-based data in the realm of indigenous craft, documenting and making our process open-source was as important to us as our final product to enable others to build on our work.</p>
                <h5>Process Value System</h5>
                <p><b>Participatory:</b> Having little to no exposure to Native American history, culture, and quilt making, we collaborated with several experts in the field to guide our project focus, research questions, and final outcome.</p>
                <p><b>Accuracy:</b> As Native American quilting is not a well-documented folk art form, not all research and data sources were reliable. We adopted a strict and rigorous process to fact-check our research with experts and designed ways to navigate any corruption in the data. </p>
                <h5>Project Value System</h5>
                <p><b>Self-initiated learning:</b> Our tool is designed to be more exploratory over explanatory, discovery-led, and promotes self-initiated learning.</p>
                <p><b>Sensitive:</b> As Native American tribes are our primary subject, our tool aims to ensure that the final product is sensitive to their history, culture, and tradition.</p>
                <p><b>Transparent:</b> To enable others to build on our work, we will make our data sources, process, and created datasets openly available. We also understand that our datasets are not perfect and thus wish to provide an open platform for members of the community or experts to correct any of the work we have put out. We are also transparent about the representation of tribes within the data, making our biases aware and known.</p>

                <h4 class="head">Problem</h4>
                <p>As we dove deeper into the story of Native American quilting culture to develop research questions, a few challenges were apparent to us almost instantly:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Few credible online resources on Native American Quilting culture</li>
                    <li>Discrepancy in the information presented in online resources</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We addressed these challenges by referring to physical books from Harvard libraries and consulting with experts on the information and insights we derived throughout the process.</p>
                <p>Due to the nuance in Native American culture and history and our responsibility to represent them accurately, our research phase extended throughout the design process.</p>

                <h4 class="head">Key Research Findings</h4>
                <h5>General Information</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>The lack of documented evidence obscures the history of American quilts prior to 1750.</li>
                    <li>At significant milestones in community life, such as the birth of a baby, weddings, or when a triumphant warrior returned, star quilts were gifted. Morning Star quilts were draped over caskets at funerals and passed from one family to another in giving ceremonies. Quilts were also designed to make political statements.</li>
                    <li>Textile scraps and rug scraps were initially used to make quilts.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Influence</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quilts were found not only in the colder latitudes where the English, Dutch, and Welsh settled down and brought a tradition of quilting with them but also spread and adopted by communities with no quilting heritage or functional need for quilts. Quilts are ubiquitous in America and a mode of creative expression.</li>
                    <li>Native American quilting aesthetics have roots in non-native communities such as New England, England, and India.</li>
                    <li>Quilt-making was introduced to Native communities primarily by Indian boarding schools to Native children to enact Western assimilation.</li>
                    <li>Tribes that moved together, have common ancestors, and were known to be enemies or allies during a specific period may have shared knowledge on quilting.</li>
                    <li>Knowledge was shared from one generation to another through women in quilting bees (community groups during quilt-making sessions). During these sessions, the women could talk freely about a breadth of topics, from housekeeping tips to political views.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Color and Symbolism</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Experimentation with synthetic dyes in the 1900's led to a more diverse color palette.</li>
                    <li>The colors and symbols featured on Native American quilts represent their cultural identity. Color significance, symbolism, and names given to these symbols vary across communities.</li>
                    <li>Native American tribes have reused patterns used in traditional artifacts such as hyde paintings, buffalo robes, and tipis (conical tents made of skins, cloth, or canvas on a frame of poles) on quilts.</li>
                    <li>Tribes are inspired by nature and incorporate natural elements into their design.</li>

The RAWGraphs visualizations were exported to Figma and further refined.</p>
                <p>The Alluvial diagram and area chart allowed users to perceive different colors. However, to reduce clutter, we could remove the names of the specific tribes and retain the landscape name and color palette. The names of the specific tribes could be revealed upon hovering over the various types of landscapes.</p>
                <p>Too many tribes would distract the user from making necessary inferences. Thus we chose to only focus on our majority representation.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Use dashed lines in the visualization rather than solid ones to indicate a thread-like texture, reduce the intensity of each color, and make all colors easily comprehensible.</li>
                    <li>Place the US map right next to the names of the tribes for better readability.</li>

                    <li>Use perspective or a 3D space-like feel to make the user feel like they are moving through space and time to view the quilts.</li>
                    <li>Avoid using color as a legend because analysis of color is one of our main views and thus will only confuse people.</li>
