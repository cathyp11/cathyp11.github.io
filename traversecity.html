                <h1>Road Trip to Traverse City and Sleeping Bear Dunes</h1>
                <p>08.24.2020</p>
                <p>Before leaving the states, I wanted to go on a memorable trip with my friends to explore the upper Michigan. Although I couldn't go to the UP (Upper Peninsula", it was my very first time driving up north part of Michigan while living here for about 6 years. I've heard so much about how beautiful the upper part of Michigan is during summer and the famous Traverse City. Whenever I ask where to visit in Michigan, it was always Traverse City. I'm glad that I was able to visit before I leave. The Sleeping Bear Dunes was nothing I expected either. The sand hill was steeper than any mountain that I've ever climbed. I would love to visit again but definitely won't be a day trip!</p>
