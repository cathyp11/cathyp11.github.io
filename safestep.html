                <h4>Ensuring real-world effectiveness through comprehensive testing</h4>
                <h5>User Testing and Feedback</h5>
                <p>
                    SafeStep underwent extensive user testing with visually impaired individuals to ensure its effectiveness and usability. Feedback was gathered through interviews, surveys, and real-world usage scenarios, highlighting the importance of clear and concise audio feedback, intuitive navigation, and reliable obstacle detection. This feedback was crucial in refining the appâ€™s features and improving the overall user experience.
                </p>
                <h5>Technical Validation</h5>
                <p>
                    The technical aspects of SafeStep, such as the YOLO v8 model for object detection and GPS integration for navigation, were rigorously tested in various environments. This ensured that the app performs reliably under different conditions and provides accurate, real-time information to users.
                </p>
                <h5>Iterative Improvements</h5>
