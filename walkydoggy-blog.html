                <p class="head">Summary</p>
                <p>By benchmarking similar dog products and services companies, we decided to create a blog for the Dogmaster app. Since we currently only provide services through the mobile application, we realized that there is a limitation on reaching the users online. The blog contains dog training curriculum contents available on the app and call-to-action for downloading the mobile app to read detailed instructions. The daily quizzes available on the mobile app are also one of the main features of the blog. Aside from the dog training services contents, we also have a board for announcements and events to attract more users on the web.</p>
                <p>As a UI/UX Designer, I've drafted a wireframe by benchmarking other blogs. After discussing with our teammates, I created the structure for the blog using WordPress and set up a total of seven pages for the blog, announcements, events, contents, and a few template pages for future content. By implementing new plug-ins, I successfully created those pages and received constructive feedback for improvements. In posting the contents, I wrote a thorough step-by-step guide for any of my co-workers to use the blog, even if they aren't familiar with WordPress.</p>

               <p>The two main pages that were on the top navigation bar of the website were the announcements & events page and the blog page. These pages contained a snippet of the three latest contents posted on each category. On the blog main page, I created a tile view of contents that we could highlight a few from each of the categories. The event tiles had an extra feature where a pop-up comes up if the event has ended instead of leading to the event page.</p>
